This repository contains my implementations for homework assignments of course CSE 573: Computer Vision and Image processing.
<h3>Homework 1</h3>
In this homework we were supposed build a scene recognition system which will identify what kind of scene is the image representing.
The aim of this homework was to implement this classic computer vision problem where we train our model using hundreds of images of different scenes
and then it will be able to identify what kind of scenes a test image represents. The learning technique used here was unsupervised learning using Kmeans clustering.
